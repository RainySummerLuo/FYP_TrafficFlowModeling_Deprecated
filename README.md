# 2019CSTFYP_TrafficFlow
Repo for our team's FYP project: **the Traffic Flow Modeling**

## Topic Description
Traffic flow is the study of interactions between travellers (including pedestrians, cyclists, drivers, and their vehicles) and infrastructure (including highways, signage, and traffic control devices), with the aim of understanding and developing an optimal transport network with efficient movement of traffic and minimal traffic congestion problems. This project is aimed to understand the basic theory of traffic flow and model the traffic flow.
Students in this project are suggested to accomplish following:
1.	Understand the basic theory of traffic flow.
2.	Build up a simplest model of traffic flow by using MATLAB or other familiar programs.
3.	More advanced model is encouraged to build based on the simple model.
4.	Develop a program or animation to present the traffic flow model intuitively.
