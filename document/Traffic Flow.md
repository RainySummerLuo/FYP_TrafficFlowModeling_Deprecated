# Traffic Flow

1. Modeling of the Traffic Flow

   Methods:

   - Nonlinear dynamics

   - Statistical approach

     **Discrete stochastic models for traffic flow**

     We investigate a probabilistic cellular automaton model which has been introduced recently. This model describes single-lane traffic flow on a ring and generalizes the asymmetric exclusion process models. We study the equilibrium properties and calculate the so-called fundamental diagrams (**flow vs. density**) for parallel dynamics.

   - Fluid dynamics

     **An Analysis of Traffic Flow, Harold Greenberg**

     Traffic is assumed to behave like a continuous fluid. The methods of fluid dynamics may then be used except for the lowest densities of traffic.

     *Phase transition from laminar flow to start-stop-waves with increasing car density*

   - Lattice gas automata (LGA)

     Or lattice gas cellular automata, are a type of cellular automaton used to simulate fluid flows. 

   - Cellular automaton model

     **A cellular automaton model for freeway traffic**

     Our computational model is defined on a one-dimensional array of L sites and with open or periodic boundary conditions. Each site may either be occupied by one vehicle, or it may be empty. Each vehicle has an integer velocity with values between zero and vmax.

     *It generalizes asymmetric exclusion models...*

   Types:

   - Car-Following Models

     **Comparing Numerical Integration Schemes for Time-Continuous Car-Following Models** 

     Time-continuous car-following models (or more precisely, their longitudinal dynamics components) prescribe the acceleration of individual cars as a function of the driver’s characteristic behavior and the surrounding traffic.

     mathematical formulation is equivalent to that of physical particles following Newtonian dynamics with the physical forces replaced by “social forces”
